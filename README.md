# hello-world
Learning to use github
Hi my name is Mir and I want to study computer science at university next year
I love programming because it gives me the ability to control everything.
I can creat a product that is exactly like I wanted it to be.
      Anyways, IT was nice meeting your guys, rest assured, this is not the last time you will hear from me!:)
